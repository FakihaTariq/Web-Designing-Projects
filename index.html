    <p class="intro"> I was introduced to computer science through coding! I learned Java as my first language and continued to learn more as time went on. This is a website dedicated to the different programs I've created throughout the years. Most of my programs are small and in python because python is my favorite language! It's not too complicated and easier than Java to learn.</p>
